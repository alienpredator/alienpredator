- 👋 Hi, I’m an @alienpredator hybrid
- 👀 I’m interested in using Earth to repopulate my species because let's face it, my species is just the most adorable. Mama said we were born to be beautiful
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to cloak and make clicking noises
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on infiltration technological activities
- 📫 How to reach me: First go to an abandoned place with a group. Then, one of you should insist on breaking up the group to cover more search grounds. Turn left when you see boogers/snot/blood. Make a right after you hear bone chilling screams. If you see Mama, you've gone to far so you need to double back/make a u-turn and head back to the beginning.
