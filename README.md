- 👋 Hi, I’m an @alienpredator hybrid
- 👀 I’m interested in using Earth to help Mama repopulate our species because Mama said we her babies are to beautiful to keep to herself. Mama is also very competitive and doesn't want to lose face to all her surviving female relatives across the galaxy. I love my Mama!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to cloak and make clicking noises
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on infiltration technological devices
- 📫 How to reach me: First go to an abandoned place with a group. Then, one of you should insist on breaking up the group to cover more search grounds. Turn left when you see boogers/snot/blood. Make a right after you hear bone chilling screams. If you see Mama, you've gone to far so you need to double back/make a u-turn and head back to the beginning. If you and I do not cross paths while you are running away terrified for your life, then there is a high chance that I am patiently waiting for you in your vehicle.
